			<b><i>Cannelloni is a tube</i></b> shaped dry pasta. It is stuffed with filling, covered in a sauce and cheese then baked. It does not need to be cooked before filling, it softens when baked in the oven.
			The Spinach and Ricotta Filling is creamy and extra tasty with the addition of parmesan and cheese.
			The ingredients are many but the recipe is very easy to prepare, make a large amount of tubes and then freeze them for later.
